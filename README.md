## Uninstalling my Workbench Mod

To uninstall my mod, click the grey cross on the tile in StormLoader, if you go in your game you will see that all the islands are missing or broken, you have to verify integrity game files to fix this, make sure you do this step because it will always break the islands.

## Verify Integrity of Game Files

Right click on Stormworks in your steam library

From the drop down menu, select Properties

Select the Local Files tab and click the Verify integrity of game files button

Steam will verify the game's files, but this process may take several minutes
